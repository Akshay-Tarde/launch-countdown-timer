## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- See a live countdown timer that ticks down every second (start the count at 14 days)
- **Bonus**: When a number changes, make the card flip from the middle

## My process

This time, I made the desktop layout first. Then I added media queries for when my layout started to break.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Desktop-first workflow
- JavaScript

### What I learned

Using JavaScript to write timer logic was really great.  
Updating the timer each second was a really great exercise.

### Continued development

Future work would be to implement the bonus part of this challenge, i.e., to add in the flip animation each time the counter changes.
